\item "standard": Project overview, input files, BLAST summaries, and updates
\item "detailed": All standard content plus plots, detailed statistics, and advanced analysis
}}

\item{open_report}{Logical. If TRUE, attempt to open the report in RStudio. Default is TRUE}

\description{
Creates a dynamic Rmd/Qmd report that automatically updates as the database grows.
This report provides a living document of your analysis progress, with sections
for project overview, current status, and timestamped updates.
}
\details{
The report includes several key sections:
\itemize{
\item Project Overview: Basic project information and metadata
\item Current Database Status: Live table counts and statistics
\item Project Summary: Input files, BLAST searches, and annotations
\item Analysis Updates: Timestamped log of analysis progress (auto-updated)
}

The report is designed to be kept open in RStudio during analysis, providing
real-time insight into analysis progress and results.

# Basic usage - create standard Rmd report
con <- connect_funseq_db("my_analysis.db")

report_path <- create_analysis_report(con, project_id)
# Creates: "MyProject_analysis_report.Rmd"

# Create Quarto report with detailed template
create_analysis_report(
  con, project_id, 
  format = "Qmd", 
  template = "detailed"
)
# Creates: "MyProject_analysis_report.qmd" with advanced content

# Specify custom path and minimal template
create_analysis_report(
  con, project_id,
  report_path = "reports/snapper_analysis.Rmd",
  template = "minimal",
  open_report = FALSE  # Don't auto-open
)

# Create report for multiple projects
for (pid in c(1, 2, 3)) {
