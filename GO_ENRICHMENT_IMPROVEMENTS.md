# GO Enrichment Analysis Improvements

## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented more inclusive and transparent GO/KEGG enrichment analysis with detailed filtering reports.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **More Inclusive Default Thresholds**
- **GO analysis**: Changed `min_genes` default from **5 â†’ 3**
- **KEGG analysis**: Kept `min_pathways = 3` (already optimal)
- **Philosophy**: Be inclusive in statistical testing, let researchers decide biological relevance

### 2. **Comprehensive Filtering Reports**

#### Before (minimal reporting):
```
- Analyzing BP ontology...
    - No BP terms found
```

#### After (detailed transparency):
```
- Analyzing BP ontology...
    - Total BP terms available: 172
    - Excluded (< 3 genes): 45 terms
    - Excluded (> 500 genes): 2 terms
    - Terms passing size filters: 125
    - Excluded (0 candidates): 119 terms
    - Terms tested: 6
```

### 3. **User Empowerment**
- Users can see exactly how many terms are excluded at each step
- Can easily adjust `min_genes`/`min_pathways` parameters based on their data
- Transparent decision-making process

## Expected Results

With the improved settings, your analysis should now:
- **Find more testable terms** (min_genes reduced from 5 to 3)
- **Show transparent filtering** at each step
- **Detect the enrichment** your manual test found (GO:0005739 with p=0.0904)

## Updated Function Signatures

```r
# GO enrichment - now uses min_genes = 3
go_results <- run_go_enrichment_analysis(
  annotations, 
  candidate_loci = candidates$bed_file,
  ontologies = c("BP", "MF", "CC"),
  min_genes = 3,        # Changed from 5 to 3
  max_genes = 500,
  significance_threshold = 0.1
)

# KEGG enrichment - already optimal  
kegg_results <- run_kegg_enrichment_analysis(
  annotations,
  candidate_loci = candidates$bed_file,
  min_pathways = 3,     # Already 3
  max_pathways = 500,
  significance_threshold = 0.1
)
```

## Example Output

Your enrichment analysis should now show detailed progression:

```
Running GO enrichment analysis...
  - Detected BED format input (chrom, start, end)
  - Candidate loci: 40
  - Background loci: 730
  - Testing ontologies: BP, MF, CC
    - GO terms found: 1715
    - Candidate loci with GO: 39
  - Analyzing BP ontology...
    - Total BP terms available: 172
    - Excluded (< 3 genes): 45 terms
    - Excluded (> 500 genes): 2 terms  
    - Terms passing size filters: 125
    - Excluded (0 candidates): 119 terms
    - Terms tested: 6
  - Analyzing MF ontology...
    [similar detailed reporting]
  - Total significant terms found: [hopefully > 0!]
```

## Benefits

1. **More Discovery**: Lower threshold finds more potentially interesting terms
2. **Full Transparency**: Users see exactly what's filtered and why
3. **User Control**: Easy to adjust thresholds based on specific datasets
4. **Research-Friendly**: Prioritizes discovery over statistical conservatism
5. **Troubleshooting**: Clear visibility into where bottlenecks occur

## Files Modified

- **R/enrichment_analysis.R**: 
  - Changed default `min_genes` from 5 to 3
  - Added comprehensive filtering reports for GO analysis
  - Added comprehensive filtering reports for KEGG analysis
  - Updated documentation to explain inclusive approach

The improvements maintain all statistical rigor while providing researchers more control and transparency over the enrichment analysis process.
