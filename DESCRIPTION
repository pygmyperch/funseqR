Description: The funseqR package provides tools to simplify functional annotation of DNA sequences for non-model species.
              This includes functions to aid in downloading relevant sequence databases, run blast searches, and assign functional annotations using the UniProt API.
              funseqR streamlines the discovery of functional elements in DNA sequences, even for species lacking extensive reference data.
              Users should, of course, remain cautious when interpreting annotations derived from distantly related species, as these may often provide limited functional insight.
